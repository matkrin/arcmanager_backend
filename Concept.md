# ARC validator concept

## DONE basic criteria

Do files/folders exist? (content doesn't matter for now)
- investigation.xlsx (redundant)
- assays
- studies
- workflows
- runs
- .arc

## Implement Basic criteria

Is basic metadata in investigation.xlsx?
- ORCID (optional)
- At least one contact obligatory: **Email**, Maybe Name...
- Affiliation
- Title
- Description
- Identifier

> Seem to be implmeneted in 'arc-validate' in way or another. Check there if unclear how to implement!
